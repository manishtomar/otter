"""Code related to creating a plan for convergence."""

# # Note [Converging stacks]
# The process for converging a group of stacks involves calling stack check [1]
# to make sure a stack is healthy. This operation changes the status of the
# stack asynchronously so it cannot be a part of gathering. Instead, stack
# check steps must be generated during planning and then the results will be
# picked up by the stack list that happens during gathering. This means
# converge_launch_stack must know when stacks need to be checked and when they
# need actual work done on them.
#
# To keep the convergence engine as stateless as possible, planning steps are
# derived from the states of the stacks themselves. This table lists the
# actions that generally result from the various stack states:
#
# CREATE_COMPLETE    | *
# UPDATE_COMPLETE    | * Explained below
# CHECK_COMPLETE     | *
# CREATE_FAILED      | Delete stack, create another stack to replace it
# UPDATE_FAILED      | Delete stack, create another stack to replace it
# CHECK_FAILED       | Update stack to have Heat fix problems
# DELETE_COMPLETE    | (Ignored)
# *_IN_PROGRESS      | Wait (run another convergence cycle)
# DELETE_FAILED      | Set the entire group to error
#
# Care must be taken to not get caught in an infinite loop of stack checking
# and creating/updating/deleting, so all of the states together are used to
# determine if the current convergence cycle is the first, (should be) the
# last, or somewhere in the middle.
#
# The planner essentially follows one of these paths:
# 1. If there is a stack in DELETE_FAILED, stop converging and set the group to
#    error. Multiple attempts can be made to delete the stack but without
#    information about the number of attempts convergence can run forever if it
#    never succeeds, so this is treated as an unrecoverable error.
# 2. If all stacks are healthy, but unchecked (e.g. all CREATE_COMPLETE or
#    UPDATE_COMPLETE), then it assumed to be the first convergence cycle and
#    stack check is run for all stacks.
# 3. If there are some unhealthy stacks (*_FAILED) or stacks in progress
#    (*_IN_PROGRESS), then it assumed that this convergence cycle is not the
#    first (and more are needed) so work will be planned out and another cycle
#    will be required.
# 4. If all stacks are healthy and there are some stacks that have been checked
#    (e.g. CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE, and at least one CHECK_COMPLETE),
#    then it is decided that this should be the last convergence cycle. All
#    stacks in CHECK_COMPLETE have stack update run on them to get rid of their
#    status [2]. This has the effect of setting the group up to be checked in
#    (2) whenever convergence begins again. The stack updates in this case
#    purposefully do not cause another convergence cycle, so convergence will
#    end.
#
# There are a few edge cases that cause more than one round of stack checking
# to occur in a set of convergence cycles, but these cases are unlikely and
# will eventually converge. For example, if stack check is run on a set of
# stacks and they all end up in CHECK_FAILED, when all of them are fixed they
# will be "healthy", but none of them will be in CHECK_COMPLETE, so another
# round of stack checking will be done. Assuming that succeeds, the next cycle
# will run stack update on all of the stacks and end convergence.
#
# [1] http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration-v1.html#stack_action_check # noqa
# [2] Updating a stack in CHECK_COMPLETE is essentially a no-op. The only thing
#     Heat does is update the status to UPDATE_COMPLETE.
